    "    \n",
    "2. Debugging:- Exception processing can also be used for debugging purposes. When an Exception is raised, Python prints a \n",
    "    trackback, that shows a line of code where exception is occured. This can be useful for identifing and fixing the bugs in \n",
    "    your code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. User input validation:- Exception processing is useful in validating input of the user. For example, if you are writing a program that asks the user to enter a number, you can use exception processing to catch and handle cases where the user enters an invalid value."
